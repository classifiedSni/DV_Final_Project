Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizing significant earthquakes globally using interactive web technologies. The dataset was preprocessed using Python (Pandas) to clean, categorize, and optimize earthquake data, which is then visualized using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, D3.js, and Chart.js.

The dashboard provides insights into:
- Earthquake occurrences by year and location.
- Magnitude severity distribution.
- Top powerful earthquakes.
- Causes of seismic events.
